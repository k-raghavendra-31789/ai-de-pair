# Alert Box Removal for Execution Errors

## Problem

When PySpark or SQL execution fails, an alert box pops up displaying the error message. This is redundant because the TerminalPanel already handles and displays execution error messages in a more appropriate UI context.

## Solution

Removed the `alert()` calls that show execution failure messages, keeping only the console logging for debugging purposes.

## Changes Made

### 1. PySpark Execution Error Alert Removal

**File**: `src/components/MainEditor.js`
**Line**: ~977

**Before**:

```javascript
alert(`PySpark execution failed:\n\n${errorMessage}`);
```

**After**:

```javascript
// Error is already displayed in TerminalPanel, no need for alert
```

### 2. SQL Execution Error Alert Removal

**File**: `src/components/MainEditor.js`
**Line**: ~672

**Before**:

```javascript
alert(`SQL execution failed: ${error.message}`);
```

**After**:

```javascript
// Error is already displayed in TerminalPanel, no need for alert
```

## Alerts Preserved

The following alerts were kept because they provide immediate feedback for user input validation:

- "No database connection selected"
- "No PySpark connection selected"
- "No SQL content to execute"
- "No PySpark code to execute"
- File operation errors (download, rename, save)

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: No more disruptive alert popups during execution failures
2. **Consistent Error Display**: All execution errors now only appear in TerminalPanel
3. **Professional Feel**: Matches VS Code's behavior where errors appear in integrated panels
4. **Non-blocking**: Users can continue working while viewing errors in the terminal

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Run PySpark code that causes an error
2. Verify error appears in TerminalPanel but no alert popup shows
3. Run SQL query that causes an error
4. Verify error appears in TerminalPanel but no alert popup shows
