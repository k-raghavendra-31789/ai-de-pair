# Completion Message and Connection Deletion Fixes

## Summary of Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Generic Completion Messages

**Problem**: All code generation completions showed the same generic message "Code generation completed! PySpark code has been generated and added to the editor." regardless of whether it was actually PySpark, SQL, or other code.

**Root Cause**: The `renderProgressMessage` function in `ChatPanel.js` had hardcoded completion messages that always referenced "PySpark code" even for SQL generation.

**Solution**: Created a dynamic message system that detects the type of code generation based on:

- `eventType` metadata (e.g., "pyspark_generation_complete", "sql_complete", "single_pass_complete")
- `processingStrategy` metadata (e.g., "pyspark", "sql_generation", "databricks")

**Implementation**:

- Added `getCompletionMessage()` helper function that analyzes metadata
- Updated both completion message render locations in `renderProgressMessage()`
- Messages now show:
  - **PySpark**: "PySpark code generation completed! PySpark code has been generated and added to the editor."
  - **SQL**: "SQL generation completed! SQL query has been generated and added to the editor."
  - **Generic**: "Code generation completed! Code has been generated and added to the editor."

### Issue 2: Connections Not Fully Deleted

**Problem**: When deleting connections, they were removed from the UI but persisted on page refresh due to incomplete sessionStorage cleanup.

**Root Cause**: The system uses two separate sessionStorage keys:

1. `databricks_connections` - managed by AppStateContext
2. `pyspark_connections` - managed by TerminalPanel/MainEditor

The `DELETE_DB_CONNECTION` action only cleaned up `databricks_connections`, leaving `pyspark_connections` intact.

**Solution**: Enhanced the deletion process at two levels:

1. **TerminalPanel Level**: Updated `deleteConnection()` to use `ConnectionManager.removeConnection()` instead of direct state deletion
2. **AppStateContext Level**: Modified `DELETE_DB_CONNECTION` action to clean up both sessionStorage keys

**Implementation**:

- Updated `TerminalPanel.js` `deleteConnection()` function to use ConnectionManager
- Enhanced `AppStateContext.js` `DELETE_DB_CONNECTION` case to handle `pyspark_connections` sessionStorage
- Added error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/components/ChatPanel.js`

```javascript
// Added dynamic completion message logic
const getCompletionMessage = (eventType, strategy) => {
  // PySpark detection
  if (
    eventType?.includes('pyspark') ||
    eventType?.includes('python') ||
    strategy?.toLowerCase().includes('pyspark') ||
    strategy?.toLowerCase().includes('python')
  ) {
    return { title: 'PySpark code generation completed!', description: '...' };
  }
  // SQL detection
  if (
    eventType?.includes('sql') ||
    strategy?.toLowerCase().includes('sql') ||
    eventType?.includes('single_pass')
  ) {
    return { title: 'SQL generation completed!', description: '...' };
  }
  // Generic fallback
  return { title: 'Code generation completed!', description: '...' };
};
```

### 2. `/src/components/TerminalPanel.js`

```javascript
// Enhanced deletion to use ConnectionManager
const deleteConnection = async (connectionId) => {
  if (window.confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this connection?')) {
    try {
      const { ConnectionManager } = await import(
        '../services/ConnectionManager'
      );
      const result = ConnectionManager.removeConnection(connectionId, actions);
      // ... error handling
    } catch (error) {
      // ... fallback logic
    }
  }
};
```

### 3. `/src/contexts/AppStateContext.js`

```javascript
// Enhanced DELETE_DB_CONNECTION to clean both sessionStorage keys
case ACTION_TYPES.DELETE_DB_CONNECTION: {
  // ... existing logic for databricks_connections

  // Also clean up PySpark connections sessionStorage
  const pysparkConnections = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('pyspark_connections') || '[]');
  const filteredPysparkConnections = pysparkConnections.filter(conn => conn.id !== connectionId);
  sessionStorage.setItem('pyspark_connections', JSON.stringify(filteredPysparkConnections));

  // ... rest of the action
}
```

## Testing

Both fixes have been tested with custom test scripts:

- `test-completion-messages.js` - Validates dynamic message generation
- `test-connection-deletion.js` - Validates complete connection cleanup

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users now see accurate completion messages that match the actual code type generated
2. **Complete Data Cleanup**: Deleted connections are fully removed from all storage locations
3. **No Data Persistence Issues**: Connections won't reappear after page refresh
4. **Improved Code Maintainability**: Centralized logic for both message generation and connection management

## Running the Application

The application is now running at http://localhost:3000 with both fixes applied and ready for testing.
