# Variable Reference Error Fix

## Error Description

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'currentStage' before initialization
at ChatPanel (ChatPanel.js:582:35)
```

## Root Cause

The error occurred because I was trying to use the variable `currentStage` in the strategy detection logic before it was declared and initialized.

### Problematic Code Order:

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Using currentStage before it's declared
const currentStrategy = processingStrategy ||
                       // ... other sources
                       (currentStage?.includes('single_pass') ||
                        currentStage === 'analysis_starting' ||
                        // ... using currentStage here

// Later in code...
let currentStage = data.data?.stage || data.event_type; // ❌ Declared AFTER usage
```

This created a **Temporal Dead Zone** error where JavaScript hoisting knew about the `currentStage` variable but it wasn't initialized yet when the strategy detection code tried to access it.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Moved Variable Declaration Up

Moved the `currentStage` and `stageStatus` declarations to before the strategy detection logic:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Declare variables first
let currentStage = data.data?.stage || data.event_type;
let stageStatus = data.data?.status || 'in_progress';

console.log(
  '🔍 Raw backend event:',
  data.event_type,
  'stage:',
  currentStage,
  'status:',
  stageStatus
);

// ✅ Now we can safely use currentStage in strategy detection
const currentStrategy =
  processingStrategy ||
  data.data?.processing_strategy ||
  data.processing_strategy ||
  (existingIndex >= 0
    ? prev[existingIndex].metadata?.processingStrategy
    : null) ||
  // Now safe to use currentStage
  (currentStage?.includes('single_pass') ||
  currentStage === 'analysis_starting' ||
  currentStage === 'analysis_complete' ||
  currentStage === 'questions_complete'
    ? 'single_pass'
    : null);
```

### 2. Removed Duplicate Declaration

Removed the duplicate `currentStage` and `stageStatus` declarations that were appearing later in the code to prevent redeclaration errors.

## JavaScript Concepts Involved

### Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

- `let` and `const` variables are hoisted but not initialized
- Accessing them before declaration causes ReferenceError
- Unlike `var`, they can't be used before declaration

### Variable Hoisting

- JavaScript moves variable declarations to the top of their scope
- But with `let`/`const`, initialization stays in place
- This creates a "dead zone" between hoisting and initialization

## Fix Verification

1. ✅ No more ReferenceError on variable access
2. ✅ Strategy detection can safely use `currentStage`
3. ✅ Single pass SSE events should now work correctly
4. ✅ No redeclaration errors

## Files Modified

- `/src/components/ChatPanel.js`: Fixed variable declaration order

## Testing

1. Select SQL generation option
2. No more ReferenceError should appear
3. Console should show proper strategy detection logs
4. Single pass progress should display correctly

## Impact

- Fixes critical runtime error that was breaking SQL generation
- Maintains all strategy detection improvements
- Enables proper single_pass SSE event handling
- Restores normal application functionality
