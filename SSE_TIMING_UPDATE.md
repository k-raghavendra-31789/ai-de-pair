# SSE Timing Update - ChatPanel

## üîÑ **Change Summary**

Modified the ChatPanel to only start SSE (Server-Sent Events) connection **after the 4th question** is answered, instead of after the 3rd question.

## üìù **Changes Made**

### 1. **SSE Connection Timing**

**Before:**

```javascript
// Start SSE connection immediately for third question to catch all events
if (questionId === 3) {
  startSSEConnection(sessionId, message.generationId);
}
```

**After:**

```javascript
// Only start SSE connection after the 4th question is answered
if (questionId === 4) {
  startSSEConnection(sessionId, message.generationId);
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Logging**

Added comprehensive logging to track question flow:

- **Option Selection Logging:**

  - Question metadata details
  - Question ID and type tracking
  - Selected option values

- **Next Question Logging:**

  - Next question received from backend
  - Question ID tracking
  - Fallback question handling

- **SSE Connection Logging:**
  - Clear indication when SSE starts after 4th question
  - Session and generation ID tracking

## üîÑ **New Flow**

1. **Questions 1-3:** Normal question/answer flow without SSE
2. **Question 3:** Store processing strategy selection
3. **Question 4:** Backend sends 4th question after user selects option from question 3
4. **After Question 4 Answer:** Start SSE connection and progress tracking
5. **SSE Events:** Real-time streaming of data processing progress

## üéØ **Benefits**

- **Cleaner Separation:** Questions flow separate from streaming events
- **Better Timing:** SSE starts only when actual processing begins
- **Improved Debugging:** Enhanced logging for tracking question flow
- **Consistent Strategy:** Processing strategy preserved from 3rd question through to SSE

## üîß **Technical Details**

- **Processing Strategy Storage:** Still captured from 3rd question for later use
- **Session Continuity:** Same session ID maintained throughout the flow
- **SSE Initialization:** Includes proper error handling and connection management
- **Progress Tracking:** Initial progress message created when SSE starts

## üß™ **Testing**

To test the updated flow:

1. Start a new conversation
2. Progress through questions 1-3 normally
3. Select an option for question 3 (strategy selection)
4. Wait for question 4 from backend
5. Answer question 4 - SSE should start here
6. Observe real-time progress updates via SSE

The console logs will show clear indicators of when each question is received and when SSE connection starts.
