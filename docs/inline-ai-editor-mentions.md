# @Mentions System Integration with Inline AI Editor

## Summary

Successfully extended the @mentions system from ChatPanel to the inline AI editor in MonacoEditor. Users can now reference files directly within AI code correction instructions using `@file`, `@context`, and `@code` mentions.

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Created Reusable Components
- **`useMentions` Hook** (`src/hooks/useMentions.js`)
  - Extracted all @mentions logic from ChatPanel into a reusable custom hook
  - Handles mention detection, suggestions generation, and keyboard navigation
  - Supports all three mention types: `@file`, `@context`, `@code`

- **`MentionDropdown` Component** (`src/components/MentionDropdown.js`)
  - Reusable UI component for displaying mention suggestions
  - Consistent styling with theme support
  - Shows file source indicators (📁 GitHub, ☁️ Cloud, 🧠 Memory, 💻 Local)

### 2. ✅ Enhanced MonacoEditor with @Mentions
- **Updated MonacoEditor Props**
  - Added `getAllAvailableFiles` prop for accessing file list
  - Added `additionalFiles` prop for memory files, Excel files, etc.
  - Added `showToast` prop for user notifications

- **Integrated @Mentions in Correction Toolbar**
  - Added @mentions functionality to the AI instruction textarea
  - Real-time mention detection as user types `@file`, `@context`, or `@code`
  - Dropdown suggestions with keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
  - Selected mentions display above textarea with remove buttons

### 3. ✅ Updated MainEditor Integration
- **Prop Passing Chain**: App.js → MainEditor.js → MonacoEditor.js
- **File Access**: MonacoEditor now has access to all available files
- **Toast Notifications**: Added toast system for user feedback
- **Memory Files Support**: Includes generated/in-memory files in suggestions

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Users
1. **Open any file** in the code editor
2. **Select code** (or press Ctrl+K to select current line)
3. **AI toolbar appears** - type your instruction in the textarea
4. **Type `@`** followed by:
   - `@file` - Reference any file for full content
   - `@context` - Reference Excel/CSV/code files for context
   - `@code` - Reference code files specifically
5. **Select from dropdown** using arrow keys or mouse
6. **Continue typing** your instruction with file context
7. **Press Enter** or click ✨ to apply AI correction

### Example Instructions
```
@file:utils.js Please refactor this function to match the patterns used in this file

@context:data.csv @code:analysis.py Update this code to handle the data structure from this CSV file

@file:README.md Make this code follow the coding standards described in this documentation
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Mention Types
- **`@file`**: All files - includes full content when selected
- **`@context`**: Excel/CSV + code files - optimized for AI context
- **`@code`**: Code files only (.py, .sql, .js, .ts, etc.)

### File Sources
- **💻 Local**: Files in workspace
- **📁 GitHub**: Remote repository files
- **☁️ Cloud**: Cloud storage files
- **🧠 Memory**: Generated/temporary files

### Integration Points
- **Correction Toolbar**: Main integration point in MonacoEditor
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+K to trigger inline AI editor
- **File Access**: Real-time file list from FileExplorer
- **Memory Files**: Includes generated SQL, code files

## 🎛️ Configuration

### MonacoEditor Props
```javascript
<MonacoEditor
  // ... existing props
  getAllAvailableFiles={getAllAvailableFiles}
  additionalFiles={{ memoryFiles, excelFiles }}
  showToast={showToast}
/>
```

### useMentions Hook
```javascript
const {
  showMentionDropdown,
  mentionSuggestions,
  selectedMentions,
  handleInputChange,
  handleKeyDown,
  handleMentionSelect
} = useMentions(inputValue, setInputValue, inputRef, getAllAvailableFiles, additionalFiles, showToast);
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open a file in MonacoEditor
2. Select some code (or press Ctrl+K)
3. Type `@file` in the instruction textarea
4. Verify dropdown appears with file suggestions
5. Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select
6. Verify selected mention appears above textarea
7. Test with `@context` and `@code` as well
8. Submit instruction and verify mentions are included in correction data

### Test Cases
- ✅ Mention detection works in real-time
- ✅ Dropdown shows correct file types for each mention type
- ✅ Keyboard navigation works (Arrow, Enter, Escape)
- ✅ Selected mentions display properly
- ✅ Mentions can be removed individually
- ✅ File source indicators show correctly
- ✅ Memory files are included in suggestions
- ✅ Correction data includes mention information

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Excel Row Selection**: Allow selecting specific rows from Excel files
2. **Code Line Selection**: Allow selecting specific lines from code files
3. **Fuzzy Search**: Add fuzzy matching for file names in dropdown
4. **Recent Files**: Show recently used files first in suggestions
5. **File Previews**: Show file content preview on hover
6. **Mention Categories**: Group files by type/source in dropdown
7. **Autocomplete**: Smart completion based on file content
8. **Mention Templates**: Save common mention patterns

### Easy Extensions
